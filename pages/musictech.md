Users can select which components to emphasize and develop a mix that is ideal for their needs.

2. Increased Focus and Appreciation: Music aspects allows users to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the unique components of a song by isolating and accentuating key music aspects. It provides a unique chance for musicians, music students, and music enthusiasts to examine and evaluate the intricate elements of music.

**Interactive User Interface:** The web application has an easy-to-use interface that allows users to simply adjust and control the music parts. To create the appropriate musical experience, users can modify the volume, toggle certain parts on/off, and experiment with different combinations.
