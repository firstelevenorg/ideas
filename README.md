# Contribution Requirements

1. Familiarize yourself with GitHub with GitHub: We recommend watching this beginner-friendly YouTube video: [Introduction to GitHub for Beginners](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). It introduces you to the fundamental words and principles of GitHub and will assist you in getting started.

2. **Create a GitHub account**: If you don't already have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create one. It's completely free and uncomplicated.

3. **Access the ideas repository**: Using your web browser, navigate to the [ideas repository](https://github.com/firstelevenorg/ideas) on GitHub. Check that you are logged in to your GitHub account.

4. **Fork the repository**: In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the **Fork** button. This will duplicate the repository under your GitHub account.

5. **Make changes using the "Edit this page" feature**: Each documentation page includes a "Edit this page" link that allows you to directly amend the markdown document on GitHub. Simply go to the ideas website's page you wish to alter and click the "Edit this page" option. This will lead you to the related markdown file on GitHub, where you can make changes.

6. **Commit your changes**: Scroll down to the bottom of the page after making your adjustments. In the **Commit changes** box, provide a brief summary of the modifications you made. When you're finished, click the **Commit changes** button to save your work.

7. **Submit a pull request**: After committing your changes, you'll be sent to the page for your forked repository. Near the top of the page, select the **Pull requests** tab, then the **New pull request** button. To submit your changes for evaluation, follow the procedures given.

8. **Wait for review**: After you submit the pull request, the project maintainers will go over your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. Check your GitHub notifications for any new updates.

That's all! You can contribute to the ideas documentation repository by following these steps without needing to clone the repository or have technical experience. We appreciate your efforts and eagerly await your feedback.

# Local Development ContributionÂ 

1. **Clone the repository**: In order to work on the ideas documentation locally, you must first clone it to your computer. Navigate to the directory where you wish to save the project in your terminal or command prompt. After that, execute the following command:

   `git clone https://github.com/firstelevenorg/ideas.git`

   This will result in the creation of a local copy of the repository on your workstation.

2. Make and check out a feature branch: It's a good idea to create a feature branch to keep your modifications distinct from the main codebase. To establish a new branch and switch to it, type the following command into your terminal or command prompt:

   `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`

   Replace'my-feature' with a name that describes your feature or contribution.

3. Install dependencies and launch the local development server: After cloning the repository and checking out the feature branch, run the following command to enter the project's directory:

   `cd ideas`

   Install the project requirements next by running:

   `npm install`

   After the installation is finished, launch the development server by typing:

   `npm run development`

   This command will start the server, and you can then access the documentation by going to 'localhost:3000' in your web browser.

4. **Make changes and test locally**: While the development server is running, you can make changes to the documentation files using your favourite code editor on your local machine. As you save the files, the changes will be reflected in the browser. Feel free to experiment and make changes.

5. **Commit your changes**: When you're finished, start a new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the project's directory if you haven't already, and enter the following commands:

   `git add.`

   `git commit -m "Brief description of your changes`

   This will locally stage and commit your modifications.

**Push changes and make a pull request**: After committing your changes, use the following command to push them to your forked repository on GitHub:

`git pull origin feature/my-feature`

Finally, go to the GitHub website for your forked repository and click the **Pull requests** option near the top of the page. Then, to submit your modifications for evaluation, click the **New pull request** button.

6. **Wait for review**: After you submit the pull request, the project maintainers will go over your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. Check your GitHub notifications for any new updates.

That's all! You can contribute to the ideas documentation repository by following these instructions, either through the GitHub online interface or by cloning the repository for local development. We appreciate your contributions and eagerly await your feedback!

Please contact us if you have any questions or require further assistance. Congratulations on your contribution!
